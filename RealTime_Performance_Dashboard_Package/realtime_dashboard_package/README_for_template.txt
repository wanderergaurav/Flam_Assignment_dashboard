I cannot generate a .pbit/.pbix directly in this environment. Instead, use the included CSV and theme to build the report in Power BI Desktop.
Steps summarized:
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Load Performance_Data.csv (Get Data -> Text/CSV).
3. Apply theme: View -> Themes -> Browse for themes -> powerbi_theme.json
4. Recreate visuals (Cards, Line Chart, Slicers) as described in Dashboard_Guide.pdf.
5. Save the report and export as a template (.pbit) via File -> Export -> Power BI template.
